NBE3U Culminating Assignment

  The constructed creative product was a program designed to assign scores to characters from texts in terms of following the indigenous citizenship framework. Specifically, the product uses the Rabin-Karp string searching algorithm to efficiently scan the text for 
matching keywords related to the frameworks, while using a sparse table to ensure keywords are related to the specified character by being within a specified distance of each other. Then, the program outputs the number of occurences of each keyword, the final scores for the character for each Indigenous Citizenship Framework aspect from 0-1, and examples of when keywords were used in the text.
